    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

Our null hypothesis is that the two proportions are equal. The good news is that our available sample is actually pretty large, 4870 people. Hence, we should be able to use the two-proportion z-test. However, for us to be able to assume that the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is approximately normal (based on the CLT theorem), which is one of the requirements for the z-test, we need to assure to the best of our ability that the data was sampled randomly (i.e. resumes were sent out randomly) and that each observation was sampled independently of the other observations. The setup of the experiment seems to suggest that it is true, although I am a bit sceptical of cases where several resumes were sent for the same job opening to test the impact of lower-quality vs. higher-quality applicants regardless of race (to me this implies that some observations were not that independent after all). As long as we suppose that those conditions are true, however, and given that we have a pretty large sample, we should be able to assume that the sampling distribution of the two proportions is normal and, consequently, we can safely use the z-statistic to test our hypothesis.

    "However, this hypothesis testing is just a part of the picture. It suggests that name-based/race-based discrimination seems to exist and is important. At the same time, one isolated hypothesis test does not mean that race/name is the most important factor for callback. For example, this experiment was set up in such a way that all 4870 resumes were not 100% identical. Some resumes had more honors, some resumes had \"applicants\" living in better neighborhoods. The jobs/openings themselves were different, although the majority of them should have been in a similar industry. It implies that there were a host of other factors influencing the callback. To improve this specific hypothesis test (in the absence of any regression analysis), I would narrow down the sample to make sure all other criteria are the same. So, for instance, I would compare proportions for callbacks where all resumes were assigned to females. Then compare proportions for callbacks where all resumes were assigned to males. Then do the same for other factors (equal honors, same neigborhood). Perhaps, it's not just name discrimination, but gender discrimination as well. So what I would be interested in testing here as well is proportions of callbacks for females vs. males, for example. In other words, the particular hypothesis test above is just a piece of a bigger puzzle that needs to be carefully considered and investigated."
